## Info ##

See "LICENCE.txt" for licence information.

Each chapter with major demonstration code has a corresponding demo here.
There is also an example of code for "Hello Triangle" for OpenGL 2.1 for
reference.

Each demo has easy-to-read Makefiles for Linux, OS X, and 32-bit Windows.
There are also Visual Studio projects.

##Compiling##
The libraries reside in the common/ folder

* common/include - header files
* common/linux_i386 - 32-bit linux libraries
* common/linux_x86_64 - 64-bit linux libraries
* common/msvc110 - 32-bit Windows visual studio libraries
* common/osx_64 - 64-bit apple OS X libraries
* common/win32 - 32-bit Windows GCC (mingw) libraries

###Linux###

* install the GNU Compiler Collection - usually by installing a
"build-essentials" package via the package manager on your distribution.
* open a terminal and cd to the demo of choice

64-bit systems:

`make -f Makefile.linux64`

32-bit systems:

`make -f Makefile.linux32`

###Apple OS X###

* install the GNU Compiler Collection - usually by installing XCode
* open a terminal and cd to the demo of choice

`make -f Makefile.osx`

###Windows with GCC###

I only provided 32-bit versions of the Makefile and libraries here.
The 32-bit builds will run on all Windows machines - I use 32-bit builds on my
64-bit Windows.
If you want to add a 64-bit build it's pretty easy to copy the 32-bit Makefile and change
the folder. You will need to recompile GLFW, GLEW, AssImp, and Freetype though.

* install the GNU Compiler Collection - usually by installing the MinGW toolkit.
http://www.mingw.org/
* open a console and cd to the demo of choice

`make -f Makefile.win32`

* copy the .dll files from the main folder to the demo folder

###Windows with Visual Studio###

I provided some Visual Studio 2012 project files.
You can find an overarching solution file in the main folder. This should
convert well to most versions of visual studio. I used 32-bit versions of the
libraries, but there's no reason that you can't add 64-bit versions if you
prefer.

VS 2013 seems to work, but with 2015 you'll probably need to download a newer
version of the libraries used to get around linking errors. 

##Caveats##

* There are some lazy `assert(call_some_function())` calls that will be wiped out if compiling in a release mode that removes asserts. Replace these with your own `if (!call_some_function()) { print error and do appropriate thing }`
* Code is directly copy-pasted from book sections. This means that there will be redundant OpenGL calls to bind things etc. but I think it's easier to follow along like this.
* Code explained in prior examples is moved to a file called `gl_utils.cpp` to avoid cluttering `main.cpp`. This means that `gl_utils.cpp` is not necessarily the same in each demo, but is built up gradually.

##SDL2 Port##

Dr Aidan Delaney at the University of Brighton has made an SDL2 port (as an
alternative to using GLFW), which you can find on GitHub
